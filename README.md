# FBref_scrape

Python script to scrape FBref.com for player and team data using BeautifulSoup.

Repo contains EPL data from 1992 - 2018, but scraping tool should work for any leage on page.

Usage:
FBref_scrape.py -f <url_csv_file>

Also includes jupyter notebook with initial investigations for getting data from Whoscored.com.

This is not yet functional and left as TODO. Initial investigations required selenium package.
